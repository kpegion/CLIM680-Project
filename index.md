# Exploring the Relationship between ENSO and temperature and preciptiation patterns. 
 
## Kathy Pegion

## Introduction

My CLIM 680 project investigates the relationship between the El Nino Southern Oscillation and temperature and precipitation.  I choose this topic because it has been widely explored and written about in the scientific literature, but I wanted to see for myself.  I also explored the relationship between temperature and precipitation with another climate index, the NAO for comparison.

## Data

The datasets used in my project are:

1. NOAA/OISST
2. GPCP Precipitation
3. CPC Temperature
4. NAO Index

## Results and Codes

### Functions
I created a set of function for doing several common tasks that are used throughout my analysis,  including:
* Labelling plots
* calculating climatology and anomalies
* etc
They are located in XXXXX.py.

### Conda Environment

The `enviornment.yml` file provides the environment to run all codes.

### Figures

The figures from my notebooks are saved in the `figs` subdirectory and shown in my notebooks.


### My Analysis and Notebooks
 
1. Calculate climatology of my datasets

2. Calculate anomalies of my datasets

3. Calculate the Nino3.4 index

4. Calculate Composites

Global Temperture and Precipitation

CONUS Temperature and Precipitation

5. Calculate the Mean Difference between Composites with Significance

Global Temperture and Precipitation

CONUS Temperature and Precipitation

6. Calculate and compare Composites with NAO index  

Global Temperature and Precipitation

CONUS Temperature and Precipitation

7. Correlation of ENSO Composites for two time periods

Has the ENSO Composite changed?
